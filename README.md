The HT32SX is a System-in-Package (SiP) device build for the Internet of Things providing a **plug-and-play** connectivity solution to Sigfox Network.
It means you’ll have strong reduction in your BOM cost aiming a fast integration, simplifying design and reducing **time-to-market**. It provides both uplink (transmit) and downlink (receive) network communications. As a SigFox™ Monarch enabled device, it allows globetrotter devices to seamlessly roam across the planet taking advantage of the global SigFox™ network coverage without need of reconfiguration since region setup is done automatically.

#### USING GIT/GITHUB FOR THE FIRST TIME?
Check it out: [GIT basic usage with HT32SX](/git_basic_usage_with_ht32sx_repo.md)

#### Which branch to start a new project on?
Use the lastest software version for your hardware version.

#### Why there are different software versions related to the same hardware version?
To provied a stable code-base for developers, the **stable** versions are provided. In these, only bugfixes are made. So, when a new fature is add to the code-base, a new software version is created.
